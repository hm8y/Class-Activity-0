I don't have much experience in embedded systems. I took undergrad CompArch, and worked with microcontroller a little bit in Engineering Interactive Technologies course offered at UVa.
My interest is more HCI related, but I hope to learn more about os in general, communication between software and hardware and embedded system designs.
